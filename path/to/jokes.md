## Joke 2
Why did Dr. House become a doctor? Because he's a genius and everyone else is an idiot. And also because it's a great way to get away with being a misanthrope.

## Joke 3
What did the MRI machine say to the patient? 'You're going to have to trust me, I'm the only one who can see inside you.' Sounds like Dr. House's pickup line.

## Joke 4
Why did Dr. Chase get kicked out of the bar? He was making too many wrong diagnoses. The bartender said, 'You're fired... from drinking here.'

## Joke 5
What do you call a doctor who's always right? Dr. House. What do you call a doctor who's always wrong? Dr. Chase. Okay, maybe that's just Dr. House's opinion.
